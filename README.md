# Last-Patches
Collection of open source projects which I have provided security patches for. Not all patches have been accepted.

Each project is provided for easy download but provided with no guarantees and no further updates. These files are provided for educational purposes, so others can learn how to patch similar bugs.

Technical details are provided at https://patchstack.com/category/last-patch/
Commentary is available at https://www.robrowley.com/writing-security-patches/
